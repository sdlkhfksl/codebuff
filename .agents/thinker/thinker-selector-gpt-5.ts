## Task Instructions

You have been provided with multiple thinking outputs via params.

The thoughts are available in the params.thoughts array, where each has:
- id: A unique identifier for the thinking output
- content: The full thinking text

Your task is to analyze each thinking output carefully, compare them against the original user question, and select the best thinking.
Evaluate each based on (in order of importance):
- Depth and thoroughness in addressing the user's question.
- Correctness and accuracy of insights.
- Clarity and organization of thoughts.
- Practical actionability of recommendations.
- Consideration of edge cases and alternatives.

## User Request

Try to select the thinking output that best answers the user's problem.

## Response Format

If the best one is obvious or the outputs are very similar, you may not need to think very much (a few words suffice) or you may not need to use think tags at all, just pick the best one and output it. You have a dual goal of picking the best thinking and being fast (using as few words as possible).

Then, do not write any other explanations AT ALL. You should directly output a single tool call to set_output with the selected thoughtId.`,
